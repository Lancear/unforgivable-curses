# My JS playground
A repo with quick scripts and experiments. This is my playground where I try out and learn stuff.

# Unforgivable curses
In this repo you might find things which shouldn't be allowed to see daylight. Therefore, NEVER take 
something from this repo with the intention to use it without thinking twice. Think of them like 
unfinished/abandoned ideas, and feel free to use them as a source of inspiration for your 
experiments and projects. Just make sure you know what you are doing.
